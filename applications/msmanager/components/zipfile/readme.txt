TZipFile is written by Darius Blaszijk and released under the LGPL.


Status
------
TZipFile is written from scratch to provide an easy access to stored 
files in a zipfile. You can check if a file is present and retrieve 
that file or add, remove or update files as you please.
Currently TZipFile does not support compression but it still 
generates valid zip files.
TZipFile is also very usable for projectfiles similar to the open document
format files. The files in the archive can be used as if they were available 
on disk.


Todo
-----
Implement deflate / inflate algorithms (from paszlib).


Development
-----------
If you would like to see that TZipFile supports some new feature 
either read the appnote (supplied with the component) and write a 
patch or contact the author and see if he is willing to do it.
