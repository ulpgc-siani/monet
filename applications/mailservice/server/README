Jsmtpd is a flexible SMTP (email) server, written in java. 
It's basic features are to send and receive E-mail, following the smtp rfc. 
It comes with a set of plugins to add advanced functions. 
The main goal is to make it simple to extend to match specific usages, via plugins.
Its core is intended to remain small and simple.

Basic plugins provides: 
	-Config-file ACL (acces control list)
	-Mailbox delivery (mail is written to a unix mailbox format)
	-Remote delivery ( send mail to a remote smtp server).
	-AntiSpam filter, based on the Jasen engine (http://jasen.sourceforge.net/started.php)
	-ClamAV filter, connects to a clamd daemon to check for viruses

Future plugins will provide :
	-Unix acl (plugged to a gnu/linux system, not yet implemented)
	-Database Mailboxes
	-Database ACL
	-LDAP ACL
	


First big block of the project is a SMTP receiver service. It's bound
to a tcp port and listens for clients connections. When a connection 
occurs, the ACL plugin is invoked to check is the client can send the
message to/throught the system. The mail is then queued for the delivery
service.

The second big block is the delivery service. Queued mail are picked
and are passed throught a filter chain, each part of the chain is
a filter plugin. A filter can drop, alter or create new mail.
When a mail has successfully passed the filter chain, the server uses
again the ACL plugin to determine if the mail is to be localy or remotly
delivered. Local delivery and remote delivery services are implemented
as two delivery plugins.

Last plugin of the system is the DNSService, handling domain naming 
requests, mainly to find mail exchangers.


Mini Howto

How do I setup mail aliases ?

	First, ensure that Jsmtpd will no throw the mail away by enabling the destination Recipient in the ACL plugin choosen.
	Then, add the RcptRewrite filter to your filter tree. Set the couple sourceRecipient,destinationRecipient.
	All mail for sourceRecipient will be delivered to destinationRecipient instead. You can do aliases over different domains.
	
	Example : I'd like the mails for smith@mydomain.com to be delivered at john@otherdomain.org
	
	ACL setup : add smith@mydomain.com to your ACL (with SimpleACL plugin, it should be 
	<propertyset name="ValidUsers" value="*@localhost,*@dummydomain.org,smith@mydomain.com"/>
	
	In RcptRewrite plugin :
	<propertyset name="Rewrite" value="smith@mydomain.com,john@otherdomain.org"/>
	
	That's it, Jsmtpd will the determine if it has to handle john@otherdomain.org for local or remote delivering, and process the message.
