		(ie zen.spamhaus.org by example)

		-> Seems to be a modified gnu classpath impl ?
		-> Jasen plugin broken. Replace tiger-javamail-1.0.jar with javamail+activation.jar if you need it.
	Added GrowableThreadPool (Jsmtpd will no longer keep so many unused threads). This also needs testing !

Version 0.3b 16/04/2005
	Changed delivery service interface and implementation to support batch mail for a given domain
	Theses plugins now receives a list of recipient to deliver the mail (to the same domain)
	Delivery handler groups recipient per domain before proceding.
	This change will improve a lot bandwith and efficiency in delivery.
	The drawback is now that delivery plugins must tagg the status of each recipient when processed.
	Cleaned-up log
	Refactored IResolver interface
	Delivery service and DNS resolver interface should now be frozen (no more changes, unless a major problem is found)

	Changed ACL interface to allow to determine if a mail is really defined(smith@domain.com), or a domain bypass (*@domain.com)
	Changed code formating to a more clear and compact style
	Implemented temporary disk usage control
	Added recipient rewriter plugin :
		deliver mails to a local or remote catchall box, or remove it silently.
		rewrite a rcpt to a given other rcpt (local or remote), or drop it silently.
		This plugin is always true, and does not modify the content.

	Added a safe mode for pre-production purposes :
		If you want to use Jsmtpd in production environnement, and are not concerned by performance issues, turn this mode on in etc/jsmtpd.ini
		Any incoming mails will be written to the given path, and will stay there forever (you should purge this directlory sometimes ;)

	BlackList : enter manually in plugin-config.xml the ips to reject
	via a propertyset : <propertyset name="BlacklistedIP" value="172.16.0.200"></propertyset>
	
	RBLFilter : connects to a list of RBL servers an check
	the ip, adding servers to the plugin is done by a propertyset:

	Now stored in binary array, much more faster to read,
	save, process and send.
	
	ProtocolHandler now uses a data stream parser to build
	the array of data byte (much faster than converting to

It's intended for testing purposes


SMTP receiving service is functionnal :
	startup, shutdown, client chat ... Etc


SMTP Delivery service is partially functionnal : 
	shutdown may loose mails
	mailer-daemon error are partially implemented
	sender is functionnal

UnixMailbox Writer
	Partially functionnal, does not lock mailboxes

Jasen AntiSpam Filter
	State : testing

	State : testing


TODO :
	Email type will change in the next release*
	Fix : null rcpt
