Quick Setup

Jsmtpd needs a JRE (Java Runtime Environnement), version 1.5

Unzip the archive. You'll find several directories. 
Edit the jsmtpd config file etc/jsmtpd.ini
You'll need to change localHost to match your hostname (FQDN)

The other interesting configuration file is 
etc/jsmtpd-plugin-config.xml. Take a look at the manual 
(http://www.jsmtpd.org) for advanced configuration.


Once your configuration is done, you may start the server.
Depending on your platform, use startup.bat or startup.sh
